CELINE is a framework to play SCORM Manifest. It was grouped in three layers: 
  * SCORM Player (no matter the application context: console, GUI or web);
  * SCORM LMS (using with SCORM Player, features to construct web application that plays SCORM);
  * Web Services (using with SCORM LMS, features that can integrating other applications, in other programming languages). 

The mainly purpose of this project is constructing an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) that plays SCORM.

Version 2004 3rd is completely supported by CELINE. We will allow version 2004 4th based on the demand. We made some work of the version 1.2 but it needs more tests.

I'm workinkg alone in this project, but I'm very happy if you'll send questions. I'll explain all in the wikis.
